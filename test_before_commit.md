## Architecture Compliance Analysis

### Verified Against: ARCHITECTURE.md (v0.6.0)

#### ✅ **COMPLIANT** - All changes align with the architecture:

1. **New `/embed` Endpoint**:
   - Added to `src/routers/embeddings.py` following the existing pattern
   - Properly integrated with the translation layer
   - Follows the router structure defined in section "4. API Routers"
   - Maintains compatibility with Ollama API as per functional requirements

2. **Model Additions**:
   - `OllamaEmbedRequest` follows the established pattern for request models
   - Located correctly in `src/models.py` as per section "2. API Models"
   - Uses proper Pydantic V2 validation with type safety

3. **OllamaShowRequest Modification**:
   - Enhanced to accept both `name` and `model` fields
   - Uses Pydantic model_validator for backward compatibility
   - Maintains API compatibility requirement (section: Functional Requirements)

4. **Version Update**:
   - Proper semantic versioning following patch increment
   - Updated build date appropriately
   - Follows version management system established in v0.6.0

#### 🔍 **No Architecture Violations Detected**

### Test Coverage Analysis:

#### ✅ **Comprehensive Tests Added for New Features**:

1. **New `/embed` Endpoint** (6 tests added):
   - ✅ Test successful embedding creation with single string input
   - ✅ Test successful embedding creation with list input
   - ✅ Test validation errors for missing fields
   - ✅ Test model validation errors
   - ✅ Test upstream error handling
   - ✅ Test with additional options (truncate, keep_alive)

2. **New OllamaEmbedRequest Model** (5 tests added):
   - ✅ Test minimal request with single string input
   - ✅ Test minimal request with list input
   - ✅ Test with all optional fields
   - ✅ Test validation for missing required fields
   - ✅ Test empty input validation

3. **Modified OllamaShowRequest** (1 test added):
   - ✅ Test with 'model' field only
   - ✅ Test with both 'name' and 'model' fields
   - ✅ Test validation error when neither field is present

### Test Quality:

All new tests follow best practices:
- Proper mocking of external dependencies
- Comprehensive error case coverage
- Both success and failure scenarios tested
- Input validation thoroughly tested
- Response format verification
