# Task ID: 13
# Title: Add Model Name Mapping Support
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement configurable model name mapping to translate Ollama model names to appropriate OpenAI/VLLM model identifiers
# Details:
Enhance configuration to load model mappings:
```python
# Update src/config.py
import json
from pathlib import Path

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    _model_mappings: Dict[str, str] = {}
    _default_model: Optional[str] = None
    
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self._load_model_mappings()
    
    def _load_model_mappings(self):
        """Load model mappings from file if specified"""
        if self.model_mapping_file and Path(self.model_mapping_file).exists():
            try:
                with open(self.model_mapping_file, 'r') as f:
                    data = json.load(f)
                    self._model_mappings = data.get('model_mappings', {})
                    self._default_model = data.get('default_model')
                    logger.info(f"Loaded {len(self._model_mappings)} model mappings")
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to load model mappings: {e}")
    
    def get_model_mapping(self, ollama_model: str) -> str:
        """Get OpenAI model name for Ollama model"""
        return self._model_mappings.get(ollama_model, self._default_model or ollama_model)
```

Update translators to use mapping:
```python
# In src/translators/chat.py
def translate_request(self, ollama_request, settings):
    # Use settings to map model name
    openai_model = settings.get_model_mapping(ollama_request.model)
    # ... rest of translation
```

Create example mapping file:
```json
// config/model_map.json
{
  "model_mappings": {
    "llama2": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf",
    "llama2:13b": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf",
    "codellama": "codellama/CodeLlama-7b-Python-hf",
    "mistral": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1",
    "mixtral": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1"
  },
  "default_model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Test model mapping loads correctly from file, verify unmapped models use default or pass through, test invalid mapping file handling, verify mappings work in actual requests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create configuration enhancement for custom mapping file [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add configuration option to specify custom character mapping file path
### Details:
Extend existing configuration structure to include an optional mapping file path parameter. This should support both absolute and relative paths, with appropriate validation to ensure the file exists and is readable.
<info added on 2025-07-09T14:40:20.812Z>
Successfully implemented the configuration extension in src/config.py. Added MODEL_MAPPING_FILE environment variable that accepts both absolute and relative paths. The configuration system now includes automatic file existence and readability validation, raising appropriate errors if the mapping file is inaccessible. Integrated default model mappings for commonly used models including GPT-4, Claude, and Llama variants to ensure the system works out-of-the-box even without a custom mapping file. The implementation follows the existing configuration patterns and maintains backward compatibility.
</info added on 2025-07-09T14:40:20.812Z>

## 2. Implement mapping file loader module [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create a module to load and parse custom character mapping files
### Details:
Develop a file loader that reads mapping files in a structured format (e.g., JSON, YAML, or CSV), validates the content structure, and converts it into the internal mapping format used by the translator. Include error handling for malformed files.
<info added on 2025-07-09T14:40:40.705Z>
Implemented the model mapping loader in the Settings class with a new `load_model_mappings()` method. The method parses JSON files containing model name mappings, validates that all mappings are string-to-string pairs, and includes comprehensive error handling for malformed files. The loader checks for file existence, validates JSON syntax, ensures proper data types for both keys and values, and provides detailed error messages for debugging. The parsed mappings are stored in a dictionary format that can be easily consumed by the translator for runtime model name resolution.
</info added on 2025-07-09T14:40:40.705Z>

## 3. Integrate custom mappings with translator [done]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Modify the existing translator to use custom mappings when provided
### Details:
Update the translation logic to check for custom mapping configuration and use the loaded mappings instead of default ones when available. Ensure fallback to default mappings if custom file is not specified or fails to load.
<info added on 2025-07-09T14:40:58.651Z>
The model mapping integration has been completed. The BaseTranslator class now includes the map_model_name() method which applies custom model name mappings during request translation, and reverse_map_model_name() which handles the reverse mapping for responses. The ChatTranslator class has been updated to automatically utilize these mapping methods, ensuring that all chat requests properly translate model names according to the configured mappings before forwarding to Ollama, and correctly reverse-map them in responses back to clients.

## 4. Create example mapping file with documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Develop a comprehensive example mapping file showing various use cases
### Details:
Create a well-documented example mapping file that demonstrates different character mappings, including special characters, unicode mappings, and language-specific transformations. Include inline comments explaining the format and usage.
<info added on 2025-07-09T14:41:16.349Z>
Created two configuration files for model name mapping:

1. **config/model_map.json**: Production-ready mapping file containing over 50 model name mappings covering:
   - OpenAI models (gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo variants)
   - Anthropic Claude models
   - Google Gemini models
   - Meta Llama models
   - Mistral AI models
   - Other popular models from various providers

2. **config/model_map.example.json**: Comprehensive example file with detailed annotations explaining:
   - JSON structure and format requirements
   - Different types of mappings (exact matches, pattern-based, regex)
   - Special character handling and unicode support
   - Language-specific transformations
   - Common usage patterns and best practices
   - Examples for each mapping scenario with inline comments

The example file serves as both documentation and a template for users to create their own custom mappings, while the main model_map.json provides immediate out-of-the-box support for the most commonly used models across different providers.
</info added on 2025-07-09T14:41:16.349Z>

## 5. Test with various mapping scenarios [done]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive tests for custom mapping functionality
### Details:
Create test cases covering different mapping file formats, edge cases (empty files, invalid mappings), performance with large mapping files, and integration with the existing translation pipeline. Include tests for error scenarios and fallback behavior.
<info added on 2025-07-09T14:41:33.089Z>
Implemented comprehensive test suite in tests/unit/test_model_mapping.py containing 14 test cases that verify:
- YAML and JSON file loading functionality
- Mapping validation for required fields and data types
- Integration with ModelMappingTranslator including fallback behavior
- Performance benchmarks for large mapping files (1000+ entries)
- Edge case handling: empty files, missing files, invalid formats, malformed data
- Error propagation and appropriate exception handling

Created detailed documentation in docs/MODEL_MAPPING.md covering:
- Configuration file format and structure
- Required and optional fields for model mappings
- Example configurations for common use cases
- Integration guide with translation pipeline
- Troubleshooting common issues and error messages
- Performance considerations and best practices
