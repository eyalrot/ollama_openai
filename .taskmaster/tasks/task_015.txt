    buffer = []
    buffer_size = 0
    max_buffer_size = 1024  # bytes

## 5. Implement memory-efficient metric storage [done]

Use ring buffers for recent metrics, implement automatic rollup for older data, add configurable retention policies, ensure proper cleanup of expired metrics, implement memory usage limits
<info added on 2025-07-09T22:15:55.361Z>
The memory-efficient metric storage functionality has been verified as fully implemented.
