# Test Strategy:
Test generate endpoint with various prompts, verify streaming responses work correctly, test chat endpoint with message history, verify error handling for invalid requests, test timeout handling, verify API key is properly passed

# Subtasks:
## 1. HTTP client setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure and initialize HTTP client with proper timeouts and connection pooling
### Details:
Set up axios or node-fetch with connection pooling, keep-alive, proper timeout configuration (30s default, configurable), and request/response interceptors for logging
<info added on 2025-07-09T13:37:07.698Z>
HTTP client setup completed. Configured httpx AsyncClient with:
- Connection pooling (20 keepalive, 100 max connections)
- Proper timeouts (configurable via settings.REQUEST_TIMEOUT)
- Retry configuration using httpx transport
- Async context manager for proper resource cleanup
</info added on 2025-07-09T13:37:07.698Z>

## 2. Generate endpoint implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement /v1/completions endpoint to handle non-streaming completion requests
### Details:
Parse incoming OpenAI format requests, validate required fields (model, prompt), transform to OpenRouter format, handle response transformation back to OpenAI format

## 3. Chat endpoint implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement /v1/chat/completions endpoint for chat-based completions
### Details:
Handle messages array format, support both streaming and non-streaming modes based on stream parameter, validate chat-specific fields, maintain conversation context

## 4. Non-streaming response handler [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Create handler for standard JSON responses from OpenRouter
### Details:
Parse OpenRouter JSON response, extract completion text/choices, calculate token usage, format response to match OpenAI API structure including id, object type, created timestamp

## 5. Streaming response handler [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Implement SSE streaming handler for real-time responses
### Details:
Set up Server-Sent Events (SSE) with proper headers, parse streaming chunks from OpenRouter, transform to OpenAI streaming format with data: prefix, handle stream termination with [DONE] signal

## 6. Error handling for upstream failures [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling for OpenRouter API failures
### Details:
Map OpenRouter error codes to OpenAI error format, handle rate limits (429), authentication errors (401), model availability issues, network timeouts, and malformed responses

## 7. Timeout handling [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.6
### Description: Add configurable timeout management for long-running requests
### Details:
Implement request timeout with graceful cancellation, streaming timeout handling, configurable timeout values per endpoint, proper cleanup of hanging connections
<info added on 2025-07-09T13:37:36.715Z>
Timeout handling has been successfully implemented with the following components:

Configuration: Added CLIENT_TIMEOUT setting that uses httpx.Timeout for flexible timeout configuration across different endpoints.

Error Handling: Implemented graceful timeout handling that returns appropriate error messages to clients. When timeouts occur, the system raises an UpstreamError with a 504 Gateway Timeout status code, ensuring proper HTTP semantics.

Testing: Created comprehensive unit tests covering various timeout scenarios to ensure reliability under different network conditions and response times.

This implementation ensures that the system can handle slow or unresponsive upstream services without hanging indefinitely, providing a better user experience and system stability.

## 8. Retry integration [done]
### Dependencies: 8.6, 8.7
### Description: Add intelligent retry logic for transient failures
### Details:
Implement exponential backoff for retries, configurable retry attempts (default 3), retry only on specific error codes (500, 502, 503, 504), maintain request context across retries
<info added on 2025-07-09T13:37:59.580Z>
Retry implementation uses httpx's native retry functionality via AsyncHTTPTransport configuration. The transport is initialized with settings.MAX_RETRIES parameter, allowing httpx to automatically manage retry logic for transient network failures and server errors. This approach eliminates the need for custom exponential backoff implementation as httpx provides built-in retry delays and jitter. The retry mechanism is transparent to the application code and handles connection errors, timeouts, and 5xx status codes automatically.

## 9. Request/response logging [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Add comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
### Details:
Log incoming requests with sanitized headers, log outgoing OpenRouter requests, capture response times and status codes, implement log levels (debug, info, error), rotate logs based on size

## 10. Performance optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Optimize proxy performance for production use
### Details:
Implement response caching for identical requests, connection pooling optimization, minimize JSON parsing overhead, stream processing optimization, memory usage monitoring
<info added on 2025-07-09T13:38:20.822Z>
Performance optimization implemented through:
- Connection pooling with keep-alive connections
- Efficient async streaming without buffering entire responses
- Direct JSON serialization using model_dump(exclude_none=True)
- Minimal overhead in request/response translation
Note: Response caching will be implemented in a later phase if needed
