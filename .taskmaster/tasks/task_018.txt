# Task ID: 18
# Title: Fix All CI Issues in GitHub Actions Until Pipeline Passes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 12, 10, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Systematically diagnose and fix all GitHub Actions CI failures for Python 3.12 and Docker-based workflows, iterating through each failure until all checks are green
# Details:
Implement a systematic approach to fix all CI issues:

1. **Initial CI Status Assessment**
   - Run GitHub Actions workflow and capture all failing jobs
   - Document each failure type (linting, type checking, tests, Docker build)
   - Create a priority list based on dependency order

2. **Python 3.12 Compatibility Fixes**
   - Update type hints for Python 3.12 compatibility
   - Fix any deprecated imports or syntax
   - Update dependencies in requirements.txt for Python 3.12 support
   - Address asyncio changes in Python 3.12

3. **Linting Issues Resolution**
   - Run `ruff check .` locally to identify all linting errors
   - Fix import ordering issues
   - Resolve line length violations
   - Address unused imports and variables
   - Fix docstring formatting issues

4. **Type Checking Fixes**
   - Run `mypy src/` to identify type errors
   - Add missing type annotations
   - Fix incompatible type assignments
   - Resolve generic type parameter issues
   - Update Pydantic model type hints for v2 compatibility

5. **Test Suite Repairs**
   - Fix failing unit tests one by one
   - Update mocked responses to match current implementations
   - Resolve pytest deprecation warnings
   - Fix async test issues with proper event loop handling
   - Address test isolation problems

6. **Docker Build Fixes**
   - Update Dockerfile for Python 3.12 base image
   - Fix multi-stage build issues
   - Resolve dependency installation problems
   - Ensure health checks work with Python 3.12
   - Verify non-root user permissions

7. **GitHub Actions Workflow Updates**
   - Update actions/setup-python to latest version
   - Fix matrix strategy for Python 3.12
   - Resolve caching issues
   - Update codecov action configuration
   - Fix artifact upload/download steps

8. **Iterative Fix Verification**
   - After each fix category, push to a test branch
   - Monitor GitHub Actions run results
   - Document remaining failures
   - Repeat until all checks pass

9. **Final Validation**
   - Ensure all jobs in CI matrix pass
   - Verify coverage reports are generated
   - Confirm Docker images build successfully
   - Check that all Python versions (3.9-3.12) pass

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive CI validation approach:

1. **Local Pre-flight Checks**
   - Run `ruff check . --fix` and verify no errors remain
   - Execute `mypy src/ --strict` and confirm zero type errors
   - Run `pytest -xvs` to ensure all tests pass locally
   - Build Docker image with `docker build -t test:latest .`

2. **GitHub Actions Verification**
   - Create a test branch and push fixes incrementally
   - Monitor each workflow run in GitHub Actions UI
   - Verify lint-and-type-check job passes for all Python versions
   - Confirm unit-tests job completes successfully
   - Check integration-tests job runs without errors
   - Ensure docker-build job creates and pushes images

3. **Matrix Testing Validation**
   - Verify Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 all pass
   - Confirm Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows runners work
   - Check that both PR and push workflows execute

4. **Coverage and Reporting**
   - Verify coverage reports upload to Codecov
   - Ensure coverage meets minimum threshold (>80%)
   - Check that test results are properly formatted

5. **Docker Integration**
   - Pull and run the built Docker image
   - Verify health checks pass
   - Test container starts with proper environment
   - Confirm graceful shutdown works

6. **Final PR Validation**
   - Create a clean PR with all fixes
   - Ensure all status checks are green
   - Verify no warnings in build logs
   - Confirm successful merge to main branch
